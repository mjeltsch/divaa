From the VEGFB file, the followings equences were manually removed since there were no 186 isoform equivalents:
- All fish sequences (3)
- Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis), a tooth whale
- Large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus), a bat
- Philippine tarsier (Carlito syrichta), a primate
- Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)

The gene detection algorithm of ensemble (and all others) are apparently unable to detect overlapping reading frames. The VEGF-B oberlapping reading frame is only manually annotated for the human VEGFB gene. Even for close relatives such as the chimpanse, the alternative splicing is not programmatically recognized even though the alternative splice acceptor site is full presevered. Hence, a comparison between VEGF-B167 and VEGF-B186 would require the manual extraction of the VEGF-B167 isoform from the genomic DNA from a huge number of sequences.
