Re-implementation of the DIVAA software with Biopython

For our current phylogenetics manuscript, we wanted an easy and intuitive measure for amino acid diversity in multiple sequence alignments. Such has been described by Rodi et al. (Rodi, D.J.; Mandava, S.; Makowski, L. DIVAA: Analysis of Amino Acid Diversity in Multiple Aligned Protein Sequences. Bioinformatics 2004, 20, 3481â€“3489, doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bth432). However, we could not find the code anywhere. Because the method is straightforward, we re-implemented it using BioPython.
